# Covid-19 App

This R shiny application allows users to visualize historical and latest weekly COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries globally.
The application also includes a table that ranks countries by the number of confirmed cases and provides a time series chart for any selected country.
Users can interact with the charts to filter and zoom in on specific data points, enabling them to gain insights into the pandemic's impact on different regions.
